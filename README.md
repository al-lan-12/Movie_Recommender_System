Movie Recommendation System
Project Overview
This is a Movie Recommendation System built entirely in Python, leveraging customer ratings to provide personalized movie suggestions. The system utilizes collaborative filtering techniques to predict and recommend movies based on user preferences.

Dataset
The recommendation system is powered by two CSV files containing:

User Ratings Data: Movie ratings given by different users.
Movie Metadata: Information such as movie titles and genres.
How It Works
Data Preprocessing: Reads and cleans raw data from CSV files using Pandas.
Collaborative Filtering: Uses similarity-based approaches to generate recommendations.
Recommendation Generation: Suggests movies to users based on past ratings.
Simple CLI Output: Displays recommendations in an easy-to-understand format.
Technologies Used
Python
Pandas & NumPy for data processing
Scikit-Learn for similarity-based recommendations
CSV Files as the primary data source
